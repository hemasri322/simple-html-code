# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

# DESCRIPTION

  Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
It is Based on Anamoly Detection and by Using Deep Learning Model SOM which is an Unsupervised Learning Method to find patterns followed by the fraudsters.

   Creating a credit card fraud detection program in Python that uses a dataset and provides output is a complex task. Below is a simplified example that you can use as a starting point. We'll use the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled credit card transaction data.


# DATA SET ANALYSIS

This problem has been picked from
Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


# SOFTWARE

 Then it can be more softwares are using from this project to a program run it easy for softwares are word, excel, microsoft windows, jupyter in firefox.

# INSTALLATION

 Please make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, and that you have the dataset downloaded.

 # STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT

1.We using the vscode for run the program

2.Import the libraries for numpy,pandas and sklearn in lib

3.Load the datasets

4.Data preprocessing for the dataset

5.Next split the data into training and testing sets
  
6.Create and train the model

7.Make the predictions on the test set

8.Evaluate on the model accuracy

9.Visulaize the confusion matrix and then get output.
